description=
description=[i]Original description:
description=Project Zomboid uses a random number generator (RNG) to determine whether the player gains Nimble XP.
description=This mod changes that to a new method where the player is constantly rewarded with XP for combat walking, every X (configurable) times for Y (configurable) bonus XP.
description=This means you can reliably gain Nimble XP without depending on the RNG.[/i]
